"""
The tasks a schedule may name.

A schedule that lives in settings names a task by dotted path, and that is
safe because settings are deployed. A schedule that lives in a database row
is edited by a person, and a dotted path in an editable row means anyone
holding the change permission can run any importable callable with any
arguments.

So a row does not name code. It names a **key** in a registry that code
owns:

    from django_ox.registry import schedulable

    @schedulable("reports.daily", form=DailyReportArgs, permission="reports.run")
    @task
    def daily_report(region: str) -> None:
        ...

The row stores ``"reports.daily"`` and validated arguments. The dotted path
never leaves the deployment. Renaming the module later does not mean editing
production rows, because the key is the identity and the code moves
underneath it.

Registration is discovered lazily, the first time anything asks the registry
a question, by importing every installed app's ``tasks`` module. Lazily
rather than from AppConfig.ready() so that a project not using the registry
sees no import it did not already have: nothing here runs until something
needs an answer.

    A plain Django form, so a project already knows the API and the admin
    gets per-field errors for free, with three of Django's form defaults
    closed because they are written for HTML posts and a schedule row is
    not one.

    **An unknown key is an error, not ignored.** `_clean_fields` iterates
    the declared fields, so a typo or an argument left behind by a
    refactor passes validation and then fails inside the task, hours later
    and somewhere else. Here it fails at the row.

    **A text field will not silently swallow a non-string.** A CharField
    given 5 returns "5", so a row meaning an integer reaches the task as a
    string and the failure looks like a bug in the task. If the value is
    meant to be a number the field should say so.

    Not closed, and documented rather than guessed at: an absent
    BooleanField with `required=False` cleans to False, which is HTML
    checkbox semantics. For a schedule row "absent" and "false" are
    usually the same intent, so this is left alone; use a
    NullBooleanField when they differ.
